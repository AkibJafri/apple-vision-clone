            software. Testing consisted of full battery discharge while performing each of the following tasks: video
            playback, internet browsing, spatial video capture, and FaceTime. Video playback tested in conjunction with
            an Environment, using 2D movie content purchased from the Apple TV app. Internet browsing tested using 20
            popular websites. FaceTime tested between two Apple Vision Pro units with Personas enabled. Tested with
